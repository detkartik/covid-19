# covid-19

- This is one page application developed to track the daily corona virus cases

# Purpose/Motivation -
- As corona virus is spreading worldwide and it has impacted our social life. 
-  I thought of building an application which can be able to track overall cases in India on the daily basis.
-  Although there are several resources to track it,but I have developed this to do some hands on with Django.
